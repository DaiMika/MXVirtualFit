A brief talk on the project.

My name is Maxyn Edogha. I am a software engineer. I made sure the application runs smoothly by handling the backend development. With the help of mentors who are experienced in UI/UX designing by creating intuitive engaging user interfaces to provide the best services for users. 

I have a passion for fitness. While growing up, I engage in various sports, and before doing this, there is always a workout session with my coach which in turn I provide fitness services to clients to keep fit and healthy. 

So creating  MXVirtualFit is a step further to reach out to a wider audience, to make fitness more accessible and effective, and the best part is you can keep fit at your comfort following necessary workout procedures with the option Personalised Workout Plans. With this, you can achieve your specific fitness objectives. 

There is also the Progress Tracking to help motivate you by providing detailed reports and analysis to see how far you go in the journey of fitness. I am really excited about this, and there will be improvements where necessary on the features as planned.
